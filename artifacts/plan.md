## Overview

The webpage is a promotional landing page for a service called "jive." It features a clean, modern design with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The layout is vertically structured with the following key sections:

1. **Header:**
   - Contains the logo "jive" on the left.
   - Navigation links for "Login" and "Sign up" on the right.

2. **Hero Section:**
   - Large, bold headline: "Don’t make connecting awkward."
   - Subheading explaining the service.
   - A prominent "Sign up free" button.
   - Background with abstract colorful shapes.

3. **Visual Section:**
   - Two overlapping smartphone images displaying a QR code and a messaging interface.

4. **How It Works Section:**
   - Title: "Here’s how it works."
   - Three-step process with icons and descriptions:
     1. Scan the QR code
     2. Send a message
     3. Follow-up from your inbox
   - "Start jiving" button.

5. **Footer:**
   - Logo repetition.
   - Links for "About," "Privacy," "Terms," and "Contact."
   - Copyright notice.

### Layout Considerations

- **Flexbox vs. Grid:** The layout can be efficiently implemented using CSS Flexbox for vertical alignment and spacing. Grid could be used for the "How It Works" section to align the icons and text in a structured manner.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure the design is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, especially for mobile devices.
- **Background Shapes:** Use CSS for the abstract shapes, possibly with pseudo-elements or background images.
